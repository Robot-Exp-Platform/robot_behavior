//! Coordinate frames of a robot cell: one tree of static, joint-driven and
//! dynamic transforms, looked up at an instant.
//!
//! - [`frame_id`] derives a [`FrameId`] from a frame name at compile time, so
//!   producers can fill `Header::frame` without holding a registry.
//! - [`FrameTree`] fixes the topology and the static transforms when it is
//!   built: URDF links and joints through [`FrameTreeBuilder::model`],
//!   calibrated extrinsics through [`FrameTreeBuilder::fixed`].
//! - [`FrameBuffer`] keeps a time history of joint positions and dynamic
//!   transforms on one clock and answers [`FrameBuffer::lookup`] at a
//!   [`Stamp`]. Writes and lookups do not allocate and never block.
//! - [`calibration`] solves a camera's mount from paired arm and target poses
//!   (hand-eye calibration), for the fixed edge it becomes.
//! - Feature `roplat` adds [`roplat::JointStateNode`], which records joint
//!   states into a borrowed buffer.
//!
//! There is no global registry or buffer: a `FrameBuffer` is an ordinary value
//! owned by its creating scope and lent to nodes as a resource.
//!
//! [`Stamp`]: roplat_msgs::Stamp
