//! Planning-scene geometry placed from the frame buffer (feature `scene`).
//!
//! A [`PlanningScene`] is plain data with no clock; the [`FrameBuffer`]
//! knows where every frame was at each instant. These connect the two:
//!
//! - [`place_objects`] moves scene objects that perception tracks as frames
//!   to where the buffer has them at a stamp;
//! - [`add_sensed_points`] adds a depth reading at the camera pose of the
//!   instant it was taken. For a camera on the arm that is where the joints
//!   put it then, interpolated from the recorded joint states, not where the
//!   arm is by the time the points are processed.
//!
//! `world` is the frame the scene's world is in: the tree's frame in which
//! [`PlanningScene::base`] places the robot.
