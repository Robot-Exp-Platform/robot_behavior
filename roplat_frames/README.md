# roplat_frames

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Coordinate frames of a robot cell: one tree of static, joint-driven and dynamic transforms, looked up at an instant, and the camera calibration that fixes its sensor edges.

Part of the [roplat_behavior workspace](../README.md). 0.9 is not on crates.io yet; build it from source as [Working from source](../README.md#working-from-source) describes.

## Contents

- `frame_id` derives a `FrameId` from a frame name at compile time, so producers can fill `Header::frame` without holding a registry.
- `FrameTree` fixes the topology and the static transforms when it is built: URDF links and joints through `FrameTreeBuilder::model`, calibrated extrinsics through `FrameTreeBuilder::fixed`.
- `FrameBuffer` keeps a time history of joint positions and dynamic transforms on one clock and answers `FrameBuffer::lookup` at a `Stamp`. Writes and lookups do not allocate and never block.
- Hand-eye calibration of a camera mount (`calibration::calibrate_hand_eye`, eye in hand or eye to hand), for the fixed edge it becomes.
- The target pose from images: `target::detect_chessboard` finds a chessboard's corners to a fraction of a pixel, in an order fixed across views, and `target::target_pose` solves the board's pose.
- Lens distortion as `CameraInfo` describes it: `lens::distort`, `lens::undistort` and `lens::Rectify` for the plumb_bob, rational polynomial and fisheye models, as `image_proc` rectifies.
- Feature `roplat`: `JointStateNode`, which records joint states into a borrowed buffer.
- Feature `scene`: `scene::place_objects` moves planning-scene objects to their tracked frames at a stamp, and `scene::add_sensed_points` adds a depth reading at the camera pose of its stamp.

There is no global registry or buffer: a `FrameBuffer` is an ordinary value owned by its creating scope and lent to nodes as a resource. The [frame tree design (zh)](docs/design_zh.md) explains its choices and what is left open.
