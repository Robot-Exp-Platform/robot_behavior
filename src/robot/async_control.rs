/// executor or creating a nested runtime. The driver's documentation specifies
/// which I/O runtime the future needs; this trait itself has no Tokio dependency.

/// Each callback is awaited to completion, and callbacks never overlap.

/// The session returns only after its termination protocol finishes or fails.
/// This is cooperative completion, not a guarantee for dropped futures or panic.
/// Device termination is not object lifecycle shutdown or an emergency stop.
