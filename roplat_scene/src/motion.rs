//! Checking a straight joint motion as a whole, not at samples.
//!
//! The planners in `roplat_trajectory` check a segment between two
//! configurations by sampling it every `resolution` radians. Between two
//! samples a link sweeps a band as wide as the step times its distance from
//! the joints that move it, and a thin plate or a corner inside that band is
//! missed. [`PlanningScene::motion_contact`] certifies the whole motion
//! instead, by conservative advancement (Schwarzer, Saha and Latombe,
//! "Adaptive dynamic collision checking for single and multiple articulated
//! robots in complex environments", IEEE T-RO 21(3), 2005):
//!
//! - Along the motion `q(s) = from + s · (to − from)`, no point of a body
//!   moves faster than a bound found from the robot's geometry: for each
//!   moving joint, the step of that joint times the farthest the body can
//!   reach from the joint's axis. A pair's distance shrinks no faster than
//!   the sum of the two bounds, counting only joints below the pair's
//!   common ancestor, since joints above it move both bodies together.
//! - At `s` each pair that might still meet is measured; the motion then
//!   advances by the smallest clearance over its pair's bound, which no pair
//!   can use up. Pairs that cannot meet before the end, by distance or by
//!   their bounding boxes, are dropped.
//!
//! The steps are as long as the clearance allows: far from everything a
//! motion is certified in one or two measurements, near an obstacle the
//! steps shrink with the clearance. A pair whose clearance above the
//! padding falls to [`MOTION_TOLERANCE`] counts as touching, which ends the
//! advance where a motion grazes an obstacle.
