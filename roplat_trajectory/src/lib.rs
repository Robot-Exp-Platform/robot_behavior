//! Trajectory generation: joint and Cartesian interpolation (linear,
//! trapezoid, S-curve, fourth-order) in [`path_generate`], time-optimal path
//! parameterization through COPP in [`time_scaling`], collision-free
//! joint-space paths in [`path_planning`] and their simplification and
//! smoothing in [`path_smoothing`], straight tip paths checked in
//! joint space in [`cartesian_path`], and following a timed joint trajectory
//! on a position channel in [`follow`].
//!
//! The crate takes limits as `roplat_msgs` data ([`JointLimits`],
//! [`CartesianLimits`]) and the control period as a `Duration`, never a robot
//! type, so it depends only on `roplat_msgs` and `copp`. An unbounded entry is
//! `f64::INFINITY`.

//! [`JointLimits`]: roplat_msgs::JointLimits
//! [`CartesianLimits`]: roplat_msgs::CartesianLimits
